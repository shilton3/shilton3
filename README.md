## 🌟 About Me

I’m a career-changing Computer Science student at Western Governors University (WGU) with a strong foundation in **Java**, **SQL**, **Spring Framework**, and **object-oriented programming**. My background includes several years of professional experience leading complex technical initiatives, analyzing data, developing structured workflows, and communicating technical information clearly to diverse stakeholders. I have experience in both the public and private sectors. This has prepared me to communicate effectively across multiple domains in order to deliver on project goals. 

I’m passionate about backend development, modern web technologies, and building efficient systems that make a real impact. I’m continuing to expand my skills in **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **React**, **GraphQL** and **Next.js** as I pursue software engineering roles and other computer science related roles such as AI/ML Engineering.
